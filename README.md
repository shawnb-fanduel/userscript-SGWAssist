<img alt="user-script header" src="https://github.com/shawnb-fanduel/ops-highlightdates/blob/main/assets/header.png?raw=true"/>


This UserScript enhances the SGW site by highlighting post times based on specific criteria. It uses JavaScript to dynamically modify the appearance of the table after the page has loaded completely.

It works on both production and development SGW sites.


## Functionality Overview

This UserScript employs JavaScript to perform the following:

- Highlights cells with dates that do not match the card date
- Highlights cells with race times between 1AM and 3AM
- Shorens long cells
- Highlights tracks with missing or incorrect event codes
- Highlights tracks with url breaking names
- Highlights rows with mismatching runner ammounts


## Usage

1. Install with any UserScript extension in your browser (e.g., Tampermonkey, Greasemonkey).

## Notes

- Highlighted cells are not a necessarily an issue, it is just to bring attention to that area.
