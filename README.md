# SGW Assist

<img alt="user-script header" src="https://github.com/shawnb-fanduel/ops-highlightdates/blob/main/assets/header.png?raw=true"/>


This UserScript enhances the SGW site by highlighting post times based on specific criteria. It uses JavaScript to dynamically modify the appearance of the table after the page has loaded completely.

It works on both production and development SGW sites.


## Functionality Overview

This UserScript employs JavaScript to perform the following:

- Highlights cells with today's date
- Highlights cells with race times between 1AM and 3AM


## Usage

1. Install with any UserScript extension in your browser (e.g., Tampermonkey, Greasemonkey).
2. Visit any TVGCardID page

## Notes

- Highlighted cells are not a necessarily an issue, it is just to bring attention to that area.
